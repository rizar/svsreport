The optimization problems \ref{svm1} and \ref{svm2} belong to theoretically well studied area: they are both quadratic optimization problems with linear constraints. While it guarantees the uniqueness of solution allows theoretical convergence proofs, finding a good solution for large SVM problems is challenging. The problem is active area of research, approaches include variations of decomposition method for classical quadratic optimization approaches such as Sequential Minimal Optimization method \cite{SMOplatt}, stochastic gradient descent based approaches such as SGD-QN \cite{bordes2009sgd} and many others (see a good survey \cite{largeSVM}).
